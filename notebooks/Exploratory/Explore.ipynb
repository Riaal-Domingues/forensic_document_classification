    "# Digitial forensic email classification summaries\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook makes use of gensim to illustrate using document summaries on emails.  It is an attempt to highlight some of the challenges in applying natural language processing to emails from a digital forensic analyst perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset and background\n",
    "\n",
    "The Enron email dataset contains a directory with emails for Phillip Allen (allen-p).  There are 10 subdirectories which all contains emails.  For illustration purposes the \"all-documents\" directory is used, which contains 1004 emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the literature a typical approach involves extracting the bodies of all the emails and building a wordcloud.  For our purposes we are interested in generating summaries instead which contains more information than the wordclouds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cell code\n",
    "The code below involves a little housekeeping for the rest of the notebook.  A class for summaries is in development, and makes use of the Python email module to parse the emails and extract bodies.  The class makes use of gensim preprocessing, summarization and keywords to process the email bodies.\n",

    "The standard preprocessing applied by gensim strips all newline characters, single and double. The pre-processed email contains no paragraphs at all.  If the NLP functions to follow requires knowledge of paragraphs e.g. par2vec, the information would be lost and each email will be regarded as a complete single paragraph.\n",

ConceptNet Numberbatch is a snapshot of just the word embeddings.
